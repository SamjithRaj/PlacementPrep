As of today, September 20th, 2025, my journey begins. This tracker is not just a project; it's my personal command center. I built it to hold myself accountable, to visualize every small victory on the path to a top-tier tech career, and to turn a daunting goal into a series of manageable, daily tasks. It's a testament to the idea that great achievements are the sum of small, consistent efforts.
